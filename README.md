I change the quadrupled creature into a dog 4-feet dog like creature. I fixed the leg to move along x axis. While I selected the creature over the movement on negative y-axis direction. I hope to see whether the creature will learn turn around.

The creatuer indeed learns turn around first and move in straight afterwards as expected.
